Explore our three interactive options: **Text**, **Images**, and **PDFs**. Each option leverages the power of ChatGPT models to provide a tailored experience:

| Application | Interaction Mode                                                    | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Text**    | Direct Text Input                                                   | Engage directly with ChatGPT models through text. Ideal for queries, conversations, and text analysis. |
| **Images**  | Image Upload                                                        | Interact with ChatGPT models by uploading images. Perfect for image-based inquiries and analyses. |
| **PDFs**    | PDF Upload                                                          | Upload PDF documents to extract text and interact with ChatGPT models. Suitable for document analysis and information extraction. |

**Note:** This application is still in its experimental phase. We are actively fixing bugs and refining features. As Brian Fantana from *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy* famously remarked:

> "60% of the time, it works every time."

We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve this application!
